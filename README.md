# Zen Games
**Zen Games** is an open-source collection of small puzzle games built with Godot for Android and Web.
Designed as a quiet digital toybox, each game focuses on relaxed mechanics, no lose conditions, and a cohesive modernized 90s-inspired aesthetic. No timers. No energy systems.
Just tap-tap, clink-clink and some music.
