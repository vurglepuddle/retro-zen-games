# Zen Games
**Zen Games** is an open-source collection of small puzzle games built with Godot for Android and Web.
Designed as a quiet digital toybox, each game focuses on relaxed mechanics, no lose conditions, and a cohesive modernized 90s-inspired aesthetic. No timers. No energy systems.
Just tap-tap, clink-clink and some music.

## Current Games
*   **Gem Match** – A relaxed match-3 variant where gems merge and go boom.
*   **Tile Chain** (90%) – A twist on NY-style tile game.
*   **Alchemical Sort** – A color-sorting puzzle with light alchemical theming (functional, visual polish in progress).
    
More small experiments and quiet mechanics will be added over time.
## 🛠 Built With
*   Godot Engine 4.3
*   Designed for Android (16:9 on purpose, but might reconsider later) and Web export
*   Open source under GNU GPL-3.0
